This is a website of a service outsourcing company of a friend.

I am still developing this website in my free time, so it may have some bugs and some pages are left.
I am trying to apply everything that I learned in my web development and software engineering courses.

The PHP is used to separate the Header and Footer files, to connect my database and to send e-mails with PHPMailer.
I made a template page which describes each professional inserted in my database, so it is much easier to do CRUD operations. The javascript is used for a better responsiveness in the homepage grid and for a better hover animation in the header navbar. The website is intended to be fully responsive using bootstrap and a little of media queries. There are some email templates that I designed with the MJML platform to make sure that they will be shown correctly in any device.

All the pictures and icons are available for free in image banks. I only have made a few of modifications to adapt them to the color palete.
